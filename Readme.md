# Simple Application

This is a project to show case some c++ code. I don't have any c++ project on my github at the moment, thus I decided to make this one
to keep as a sample of what I am capable of doing in c++.

ps: Although this is a console application, I normally don't do projects like these one. Most of my projects are developed using an engine like Unity or Unreal. Because Unreal projects weight too much, I don't post some of them here.
